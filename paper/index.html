    <p>Whether you found this site by accident or intentionally, I <strong>(Priyansh Agrawal)</strong> welcome you.</p>

    <!-- Why This Portfolio Section -->
    <h2>Warning !</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unpredictably Creative:</strong> It's not just random — it's intentionally unpredictable. I have no idea what I'm doing, but that's the point!</li>
      <li><strong>Not Perfection:</strong> This portfolio is full of errors, typos, and moments of complete confusion. But hey, that's where the magic happens, right?</li>
      <li><strong>Purposeful Uselessness:</strong> Some of these projects are as useful as a screen door on a submarine. But don’t worry — that’s exactly how I like it.</li>
      <li><strong>Never Finished:</strong> Much like my life, this portfolio is a work in progress. The projects are always changing, updating, or disappearing entirely. If you find one that's good, consider yourself lucky.</li>
      <li><strong>I'm Not Really Sure What I'm Doing:</strong> But if you pretend like you understand, I promise you’ll be just as confused as me. Welcome to my "masterpiece"!</li>
    </ul>
